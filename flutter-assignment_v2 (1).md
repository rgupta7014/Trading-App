# 021 Trading App — Flutter Assignment

Build a trading app with the 4 features below.

## LLM usage

You are free to use any LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) to complete this assignment. There are no restrictions.

## Submission

- Public GitHub repo with the source
- `README.md` with run instructions
- A short walkthrough video (Loom or screen recording) demonstrating each feature end-to-end, attached to the submission

## Stack

- Flutter (stable channel)
- App must run with `flutter pub get && flutter run`, no extra setup
- No real backend — you implement a mock market-data feed

## Stocks

Use these 10 stocks throughout the app:

`RELIANCE`, `TCS`, `INFY`, `HDFCBANK`, `ICICIBANK`, `SBIN`, `ITC`, `LT`, `BHARTIARTL`, `AXISBANK`

Pick any reasonable starting prices.

## What we look for

- Clean, readable code
- Sensible architecture and folder structure
- Correct realtime behavior under load
- Money/decimal handling
- Error and edge-case handling
- Thoughtful UI for dense data
- Clear commit history

## Feature 1: Watchlist

Users can create and manage multiple watchlists of stocks. Stocks within a watchlist can be reordered and removed. Watchlists persist across app restarts.

**Requirements**
- Support multiple watchlists (create, rename, delete)
- Add stocks via a picker showing the 10 available stocks
- Reorder stocks within a watchlist via drag
- Remove stocks from a watchlist
- Each row shows: symbol, last price, change, change %
- Live prices update in place
- Watchlists and their contents persist across app restarts
- Tapping a row opens the Buy/Sell ticket pre-filled with that stock

**Expected scenarios**
- When the app restarts, previously saved watchlists and their stocks are restored
- When a stock is reordered, its live price binding stays correct (no stale ticks shown for the wrong row)
- When a stock is removed, it stops receiving price updates and is gone after restart
- When two watchlists contain the same stock, both show identical live prices
- When a watchlist is empty, an empty state is shown
- When a watchlist row is tapped, the Buy/Sell ticket opens pre-filled with that stock

## Feature 2: Live Prices Mimic

A continuously updating market overview surface showing live prices for the 10 stocks. You design the mock market-data feed that powers this and the rest of the app.

**Requirements**
- Show live prices for the 10 stocks
- Each row/cell shows: symbol, LTP, change, change %, brief flash on update (green up / red down)
- The mock feed emits price ticks continuously at a realistic rate
- Tick rate is configurable (debug setting or constant)
- The feed is the single source of price data for the entire app
- The screen remains smooth (no visible jank) as ticks arrive

**Expected scenarios**
- When prices update, only the affected cells visibly change (others are not rebuilt unnecessarily)
- When the screen is scrolled, updates continue smoothly
- When tick rate is increased to a stress level (e.g., 5+ ticks/sec per stock = 50+ ticks/sec overall), the UI does not freeze or drop frames noticeably
- When a price moves up vs down, the flash color/direction differs
- When the user navigates away and returns, prices are current (not stale from when they left)

## Feature 3: Buy/Sell Ticket

A form to place a simulated market buy or sell order for a single stock. The order executes at the current LTP at the moment of submission. Validates against an in-memory wallet/margin balance. Successful orders create or update a holding.

**Requirements**
- Pre-fill stock when opened from a watchlist or holdings row
- Inputs: side (Buy/Sell), quantity
- Live LTP displayed on the ticket and updates in real time
- Order value = quantity × LTP at submission time
- Margin/balance check before submit (Buy) and quantity-held check (Sell)
- Show validation errors inline
- On submit: deduct from balance (Buy) or from holdings qty (Sell), record the order, navigate to a confirmation
- Persist wallet balance and order history across app restarts

**Expected scenarios**
- When LTP changes while the form is open, the displayed price and projected order value update in real time
- When the user enters an order value greater than the available balance, submit is blocked with a clear error
- When a Buy order succeeds, the wallet balance decreases by `qty × LTP at submit` and a holding is created or its average price is updated
- When a Sell order is placed for more quantity than held, submit is blocked
- When the user enters fractional/negative/zero quantity, validation prevents submit
- When prices use decimals, math is precise (no floating-point drift visible to the user)

## Feature 4: Holdings

Portfolio view showing all currently held stocks with live P&L. Each holding row updates in real time as prices change. Aggregates total P&L at the top.

**Requirements**
- List of holdings with: symbol, quantity, avg cost, LTP, current value, P&L (₹ and %)
- Live LTP and P&L updates as ticks arrive
- Sortable by P&L, by symbol, by current value (default: P&L descending)
- Aggregate summary at the top: total invested, current value, total P&L (₹ and %)
- Tapping a row opens the Buy/Sell ticket pre-filled for that stock
- Empty state when no holdings exist
- Persist holdings across app restarts

**Expected scenarios**
- When a Buy order is placed, it appears in Holdings (or updates the existing row's qty + avg cost)
- When a Sell order reduces qty to zero, the holding is removed
- When prices tick, P&L numbers update without re-fetching or re-rendering the entire list
- When sorted by P&L, the order updates correctly as prices move (e.g., a row crossing from loss to gain reorders)
- When the aggregate summary is shown, it equals the sum of individual rows at any moment
- When all 10 stocks are held, scroll and updates remain smooth during ticks
